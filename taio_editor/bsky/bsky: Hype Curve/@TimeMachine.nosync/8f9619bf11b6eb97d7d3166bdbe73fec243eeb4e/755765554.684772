The hype curve is a graphical representation developed by [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) in 1995, and enhanced by James Royal-Lawso [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity).

Something that the Gartner curve doesn’t show, is that the trough of disillusionment has two possible outcomes. An innovation can travel onwards up to the plateau of productivity, or it can falls into the innovation graveyard.

It illustrates the maturity, adoption, social application, and death of specific technologies over time.

It serves as a valuable tool for understanding how emerging technologies evolve through various phases of public perception and market readiness.


## Overview

### Phases of the Hype Cycle

The Hype Cycle consists of five distinct phases:  

### Innovation Trigger

- This phase marks the emergence of a new technology Initial interest begins by early demonstrations or breakthroughs, but there are often no usable products yet available.

### Peak of Inflated Expectations

- During this phase, media coverage and public interest peak. Many organizations begin to experiment with the technology, leading to inflated expectations about its potential benefits.

- About 50% of innovations make it to Peak of Inflated Expectations. The others stalled or dye on the assent to the Peak of Inflated Expectations 

### Trough of Disillusionment:

- As the limitations and challenges of the technology become apparent, interest wanes. Many projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment: 

- In this phase, more organizations start to understand the technology’s true potential. Development continues, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity:

- Finally, the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

- About 20% making it to Plateau of Productivity

### Inovation Graveyard

- The remaining 30% are buired in the Innovation Graveyard

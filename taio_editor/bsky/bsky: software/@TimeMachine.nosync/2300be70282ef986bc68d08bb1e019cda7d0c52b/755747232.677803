# Programming Languages

- Programming languages may initially appear intimidating, but they are simply tools that aid in the creation of software. Just like languages like English or Spanish, programming languages have their own syntax and rules, but they all adhere to fundamental principles. The absence of a character, a space, or a comma in your code will likely prevent its compilation. In such cases, your program may generate an error message that requires decoding or further investigation.

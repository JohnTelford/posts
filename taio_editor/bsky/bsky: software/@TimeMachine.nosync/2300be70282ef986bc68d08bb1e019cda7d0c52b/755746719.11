# Programming Languages

- Programming languages can initially seem daunting, but they are merely tools that facilitate the creation of software. Similar to other languages such as English or Spanish, programming languages possess their own syntax and rules, yet they all adhere to fundamental principles.

- The absence of a character, a space, or a comma in your code will likely prevent its compilation. In such cases, your program may generate an error message that requires decoding or further investigation.

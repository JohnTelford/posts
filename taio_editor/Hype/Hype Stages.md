# Overview

I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast for quite some time now. The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle), introduced in 1995, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how technologies evolve and gain acceptance. This cycle has been instrumental in helping me grasp the concepts I encounter while reading technology information. James Royal-Lawson’s analysis in [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity) further deepened my understanding of how technologies progress through various stages of public perception and market readiness.

Something that the Gartner curve doesn’t show, is that the **trough of disillusionment** has two possible outcomes. An innovation can travel onwards up to the **plateau of productivity**, or it can falls into the **innovation graveyard**. It illustrates the maturity, adoption, social application, and death of specific technologies over time. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding how emerging technologies evolve through various phases of public perception and market readiness.


## Stages of the Hype

The **Hype Stages** comprises five distinct stages:  

### Innovation Trigger

The **Innovation Stage** signifies the emergence of a novel technology. Initial interest is generated through early demonstrations or breakthroughs, but there are typically no commercially available products at this stage.

### Peak of  Expectations 

During this Inflated stage, media coverage and public interest reach their zenith. Consequently, numerous organizations venture into experiments with the technology, propelling it into the **Peak of Expectations Stage**, where its potential benefits are highly anticipated.

### Trough of disillusionment

The **Trough of Disillusionment Stage**, limitations and challenges of the technology become evident, causing interest to wane. Consequently, numerous projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment

During the **Slope of Enlightenment Stage** organizations begin to fully comprehend the technology’s true potential. Development accelerates, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity

Finally in the **Plateau of Productivity Stage** the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

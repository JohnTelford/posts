# Overview

I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast since the early days. The hype curve, a graphical representation developed by [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) in 1995, gained further significance with James Royal-Lawson’s analysis in [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity). This concept offers a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the technology industry technologies progress through various stage of public perception and market readiness.

Something that the Gartner curve doesn’t show, is that the trough of disillusionment has two possible outcomes. An innovation can travel onwards up to the plateau of productivity, or it can falls into the innovation graveyard. It illustrates the maturity, adoption, social application, and death of specific technologies over time. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding how emerging technologies evolve through various phases of public perception and market readiness.


## Stages of the Hype Cycle

The **Hype Cycle** comprises five distinct stages:  

### Innovation Trigger: 

The **Innovation Stage** signifies the emergence of a novel technology. Initial interest is generated through early demonstrations or breakthroughs, but there are typically no commercially available products at this stage.

### Peak of  Expectations:  

During this Inflated stage, media coverage and public interest reach their zenith. Consequently, numerous organizations venture into experiments with the technology, propelling it into the **Peak of Expectations Stage**, where its potential benefits are highly anticipated.

### Trough of Disillusionment:

The **Trough of Disillusionment Stage**, limitations and challenges of the technology become evident, causing interest to wane. Consequently, numerous projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment: 

During the **Slope of Enlightenment Stage** organizations begin to fully comprehend the technology’s true potential. Development accelerates, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity:

Finally in the **Plateau of Productivity Stage** the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast since the early days. The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) is a graphical representation developed in 1995.

James Royal-Lawson’s analysis goes beyond the limitations of the Gartner hype cycle to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the technology industry. For a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics, refer to [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity). Royal-Lawson’s analysis illuminates how technologies progress through various stages of public perception and market readiness. It demonstrates the maturity, adoption, social applications, and eventual decline of specific technologies over time. This analysis serves as a valuable tool for comprehending how emerging technologies evolve through different phases of public perception and market readiness. However, it also highlights the limitations and challenges of the technology, which can cause interest to wane and lead to numerous projects failing or being abandoned, resulting in skepticism about the technology’s viability. The **Trough of Disillusionment** can have two possible outcomes. An innovation can either continue upward to the **Plateau of Productivity** or descend into the **Innovation Graveyard**.

I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast since the early days. The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) is a graphical representation developed in 1995.

James Royal-Lawson’s analysis delves beyond the limitations of the Gartner hype cycle to offer a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the technology industry. For a more comprehensive grasp of these dynamics, refer to [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity). Royal-Lawson’s analysis illuminates how technologies progress through various stages of public perception and market readiness. It demonstrates the maturity, adoption, social applications, and eventual decline of specific technologies over time. This analysis serves as a valuable tool for comprehending how emerging technologies evolve through different phases of public perception and market readiness. However, it also highlights the limitations and challenges of the technology, which can cause interest to wane and lead to numerous projects failing or being abandoned, resulting in skepticism about the technology’s viability.

## Stages of the Gartner Hype Stage

The **Hype Stage** comprises five distinct stages:

### Innovation Trigger

The **Innovation Stage** signifies the emergence of a novel technology. Initial interest is generated through early demonstrations or breakthroughs, but there are typically no commercially available products at this stage.

### Peak of  Expectations

During this Inflated stage, media coverage and public interest reach their zenith. Consequently, numerous organizations venture into experiments with the technology, propelling it into the **Peak of Expectations Stage**, where its potential benefits are highly anticipated.

### Trough of Disillusionment

The **Trough of Disillusionment Stage**, limitations and challenges of the technology become evident, causing interest to wane. Consequently, numerous projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.



### Slope of Enlightenment

During the **Slope of Enlightenment Stage** organizations begin to fully comprehend the technology’s true potential. Development accelerates, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity

Finally in the **Plateau of Productivity Stage** the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

The **Trough of Disillusionment** can have two possible outcomes. An innovation can either continue upward to the **Plateau of Productivity** or descend into the **Innovation Graveyard**.

### Trough of Disillusionment

The **Trough of Disillusionment Stage**, limitations and challenges of the technology become evident, causing interest to wane. Consequently, numerous projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment

### Plateau of Productivity

Finally in the **Plateau of Productivity Stage** the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

### Silent Achievers

The innovations that avoid the most extreme hype gradually gaining traction in the mainstream, they steer clear of the pit of disillusionment. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) cites cloud computing and solar panels as examples.

The **Silent Achievers** account for as much as 50% of innovations. The Gartner Hype Cycle curve only represents of 1 in 5 making it to Plateau of Productivity.

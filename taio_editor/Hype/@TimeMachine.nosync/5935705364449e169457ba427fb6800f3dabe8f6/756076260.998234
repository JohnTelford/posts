I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast since the early days. The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) is a graphical representation developed in 1995.

The Gartner hype cycle doesn’t fully encapsulate the profound significance of James Royal-Lawson’s analysis. For a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the technology industry, click [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity). James Royal-Lawson’s analysis sheds light on how technologies progress through various stages of public perception and market readiness. It illustrates the maturity, adoption, social application, and eventual demise of specific technologies over time. This analysis serves as a valuable tool for comprehending how emerging technologies evolve through different phases of public perception and market readiness.h. Consequently, numerous organizations venture into experiments with the technology, propelling it into the **Peak of Expectations Stage**, where its potential benefits are highly anticipated.

### 

 A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.

### Trough of Disillusionment

The **Trough of Disillusionment Stage**, limitations and challenges of the technology become evident, causing interest to wane. Consequently, numerous projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment

During the **Slope of Enlightenment Stage** organizations begin to fully comprehend the technology’s true potential. Development accelerates, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity

Finally in the **Plateau of Productivity Stage** the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.

## The James Royal-Lawson’s Analysis

Adds the **Innovation Graveyard** and **Silent Achievers** stages.

### Innovation Graveyard

The Gartner hype cycle doesn’t reveal that the **Trough of Disillusionment** can have two possible outcomes. An innovation can either continue upward to the **Plateau of Productivity** or descend into the **Innovation Graveyard**.

### Silent Achievers

The innovations that avoid the most extreme hype gradually gaining traction in the mainstream, they steer clear of the pit of disillusionment. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) cites cloud computing and solar panels as examples.

The **Silent Achievers** account for as much as 50% of innovations. The Gartner Hype Cycle curve only represents of 1 in 5 making it to Plateau of Productivity.

I’ve been an avid technology information enthusiast since the early days. The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) is a graphical representation developed in 1995.

James Royal-Lawson’s analysis delves beyond the limitations of the Gartner hype cycle to offer a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the technology industry. For a more comprehensive grasp of these dynamics, refer to [The hidden curves of the Gartner hype cycle](https://beantin.net/the-hidden-curves-of-the-gartner-hype-cycle/?utm_source=perplexity). Royal-Lawson’s analysis illuminates how technologies progress through various stages of public perception and market readiness. It demonstrates the maturity, adoption, social applications, and eventual decline of specific technologies over time. This analysis serves as a valuable tool for comprehending how emerging technologies evolve through different phases of public perception and market readiness. However, it also highlights the limitations and challenges of the technology, which can cause interest to wane and lead to numerous projects failing or being abandoned, resulting in skepticism about the technology’s viability. The **Trough of Disillusionment** can have two possible outcomes. An innovation can either continue upward to the **Plateau of Productivity** or descend into the **Innovation Graveyard**.

### Silent Achievers

The innovations that avoid the most extreme hype gradually gaining traction in the mainstream, they steer clear of the pit of disillusionment. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) cites cloud computing and solar panels as examples.

The **Silent Achievers** account for as much as 50% of innovations. The Gartner Hype Cycle curve only represents of 1 in 5 making it to Plateau of Productivity.

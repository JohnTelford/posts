    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is everywhere. Websites, GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md extension.\n",

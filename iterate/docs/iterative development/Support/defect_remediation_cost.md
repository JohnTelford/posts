### Costs

- The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

- Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

##### Defect Remediation Costs

The early defect detection mechanisms built into Iterative Development and [MkDocs]() site generator are:

- VScode editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

	- Fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes and any runtime errors while typing

- Team members deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes, to Private websites where stakeholder can see them and give feedback. See Preview Deployments
